# SFD-2019
We created this website for our annual event SFD.
SFD is a global celebration of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). It is conducted every year in the month of September in different countries. SFD is a public education effort with the aim of increasing awareness of Free Software and its virtues and celebrate people doing their bit for the community. SFD is organised every year in the month of September in our University Campus.
This year is the 11th anniversary of Software Freedom Day at Punjab University, Chandigarh. Ever since its inception, SFD has grown in scale and participation at Punjab University. Every year we invite inspiring speakers from different parts of India specializing in fields such as Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Web development and many more. Our past speakers have been from a multitude of fields and various organizations like Mozilla, ROS, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, just to name a few.
